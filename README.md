# Fire-Detection

It is an Image Processing technique that can detect fire using OpenCV object detection and 
extinguish the fire as soon as possible with the help of fire extinguisher attached to it.

Here I have used Python for writing the image processing code and Arduino Nano for controlling the peripherel devices like the
fire extinguishing device , buzzer , the camera source could be the inbuilt camera of the laptop or an external USB webcam.
